# Kenya-s-Cars-Project
Project to obtain, prepare, analyze, and report about the car market in Kenya
I made this Notebook to help me gather and scrape data of cars in Kenya. I was able to scrap more than 46k cars and their details, which will be used for further analysis in the future. Just for fun and learning new stuff.
See the jupyter notebook for how it actually happened. Large file alert!
